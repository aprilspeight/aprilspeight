I'm April and I'm a XR developer based in sunny Southern California. I work in the Extended Reality (XR) space which means I spend most of my time in another reality. I'm the author of [Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Bite+Size+Python%3A+An+Introduction+to+Python+Programming-p-9781119643821) as well as [Visual Studio Code for Python Programmers](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Visual+Studio+Code+for+Python+Programmers-p-9781119773368). If you'd like to connect, you can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/vogueandcode) as well as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilspeight).
